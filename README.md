# RobotColorChangerWebApp
**TEST MY PROJECT HERE (full): https://codepen.io/nlkolluri/full/XBwPvQ/

**Editor view (works better on mobile): https://codepen.io/nlkolluri/pen/XBwPvQ

A Web Application to demonstrate capabilities of basic CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that I have self-studied. Users can click one of the three interactive (try it to see what I mean) "buttons" to change the color of a robot's exterior, front, or eyes. The project uses CSS' :hover psuedo class, click detection in JavaScript, CSS borders, skewY, gradients, z-indexes, a flexbox, navbar, link to an external site and more features in the three languages to create an aesthetically pleasing display.
